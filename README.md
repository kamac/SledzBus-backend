# SledzBus-backend

SledzBus is an app for tracking polish MPK vehicles (buses and trams).
Backend (this repository) is responsible for querying MPK API and storing the response in your database. It also exposes it's own API that provides vehicle positions (including past positions) and current vehicle speed.
